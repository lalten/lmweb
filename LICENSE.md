## Font License
The files in the folder `font/` are a repackaging of the Latin Modern
Font, originally by [GUST][1].

As required by the [GUST Font License][2] the font filenames have been
changed to comply with the [LPPL 1.3c][3]'s clause 6.a that reads:

> ... the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and
> unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this
> component to the user when used interactively with that Base
> Interpreter.

A copy of the `GUST-FONT-LICENSE.txt` is provided, as well as a copy of
LPPL-1.3c (named `lppl.txt`). Both of these files can be found in the
directory `licenses/`
